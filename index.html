  <h1>Behavioral Flywheel Engine™ (BFE)</h1>

  <p>Behavioral Flywheel Engine™ is a proprietary name used to designate a publicly archived structural existence and rights boundary declaration.</p>

  <h2>Public Anchor Index</h2>

  <h3>Purpose (plain-language)</h3>
  <p>A public citation anchor only: this page serves solely as a reference coordinate to the time-anchored OSF/DOI archive record evidencing BFE structural existence and rights boundary.</p>

  <h3>Classification (citation-only / pointer-only; non-contractual; non-operational)</h3>
  <p>This page solely points to the OSF/DOI archive record and does not add, modify, expand, or restate any legal meaning. This page (and any referenced public material) is classifiable only as a unilateral administrative instrument / rights boundary notice / structural existence notice / non-operational structural document / non-reliance instrument.</p>

  <h3>Limits (non-reciprocal; no offer; no reliance)</h3>
  <p>No technical, procedural, commercial, operational, deployable, implementable, or valuation content is stated or implied.</p>
  <p>No offer, proposal, recommendation, review, evaluation, verification, decision-support basis, availability representation, invitation, pathway, process, or reciprocal interaction is stated or implied.</p>
  <p>No permission, right of use, transfer of rights, duty of care, fiduciary relationship, continuing obligation, or reliance basis is created or implied.</p>

  <h3>Non-public decoupling</h3>
  <p>No non-public methodology layer may be inferred, presumed, reconstructed, simulated, or reverse-derived from any public material.</p>

  <h3>Likely citation contexts (indexing only; context description only; no external effect; no reliance)</h3>
  <p>A. Research / academic governance / institutional documentation (existence &amp; priority coordinate)</p>
  <p>B. Board / listing / cross-border risk / dispute narrative documentation (narrative coordinate only)</p>
  <p>C. Insurance / reinsurance narrative memoranda (narrative coordinate only; not underwriting input; not decision-support)</p>
  <p>D. Regulator or institutional observation narratives (observation context only; non-policy input; non-standardization participation)</p>
